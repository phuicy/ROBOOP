DESCRIPTION
===========

This package (ROBOOP) is a C++ robotics object oriented programming toolbox 
suitable for synthesis, and simulation of robotic manipulator models in an 
environment that provides "MATLAB like" features for the treatment of 
matrices. Its is a portable tool that does not require the use of commercial 
software. A class named Robot provides the implementation of the kinematics, 
the dynamics and the linearized dynamics of serial robotic manipulators.
